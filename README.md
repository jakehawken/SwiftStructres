# Swift Data Strucutres
The Swift standard library comes with a handful of data structures, including arrays, dictionaries, and sets. For 99% of use cases, these are all you need. However, for specialized cases, other structres are better optimized. This repository (which will eventually become a CocoaPod and a Swift Package), seeks to collect/implement as many of those as possible. Feel free to submit pull requests and contribute!

## The Current List
- Singly-linked list (have)
- Doubly-linked list (need)
- Heap (need)
- Stack (need)
- Queue (need)
- Graph (need)
- Binary search tree (need)

## Submissions
For submissions of new implementations, please include in your PR:
- A max of 1 new data structure per PR
- Documentation comments, so users can get option+click functionality (For help, read this: https://nshipster.com/swift-documentation/)
- XCTest unit tests for your data structure
